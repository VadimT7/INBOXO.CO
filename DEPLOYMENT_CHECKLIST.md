# InboxFlow Deployment Checklist

## üö® Critical Issues (Must Fix Before Release)

### 1. Environment Variables Configuration

**Frontend Variables (Missing):**
```bash
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_your_actual_stripe_key
```

**Backend Variables (Need to be set in Supabase):**
```bash
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_your_actual_stripe_key
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_actual_webhook_secret
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your_actual_openai_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_actual_service_role_key
```

### 2. Missing Demo Assets
- [ ] Create or add `public/demo/product-demo.mp4`
